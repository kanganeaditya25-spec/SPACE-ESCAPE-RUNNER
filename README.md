# 🚀 Space Escape Runner

A simple, fast-paced arcade dodge game built with React Native and Expo. Pilot your spaceship, dodge falling asteroids, rack up your score, and beat your personal high score!

Built entirely with React Native `View` components and shapes — no image assets required.

## 🎮 Gameplay

Move your spaceship left and right to avoid falling asteroids. Every asteroid you dodge increases your score. One collision ends the game. Your highest score is saved locally and persists across sessions.

## ✨ Features

- Pure shape-based graphics — spaceship and asteroids drawn using React Native `View`s and styling, no images
- Left / right movement controls with screen-boundary detection
- Falling asteroids spawned at random positions with a continuous game loop
- Collision detection between the spaceship and asteroids
- Game Over screen with final score
- Restart functionality that fully resets the game state
- Persistent high score stored on-device using AsyncStorage
- Modern UI with a gradient background and smooth animations

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- React Native
- Expo
- AsyncStorage — local high-score persistence
- expo-linear-gradient — gradient background
